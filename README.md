Neo Smart contract to implement a P2P market of real life items with built-in escrow system. 

The escrow system works by having both buyer and seller commit 2x the price of the item being sold. The funds are released when the buyer confirms the purchase was succesful: 3 parts will go to the seller, and 1 part returns to the buyer.
